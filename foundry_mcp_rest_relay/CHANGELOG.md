- First version of our own relay.
- One login page. Username and password come from the add-on options. No sign-up.
- Status lights for relay, Foundry client and world.
- Copy boxes for the relay address and connect key. The address matches how you opened the page, so https becomes wss.

- REST routes for actors, items and the rest come in a later version.
